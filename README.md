# Sort-Algorithms

1- Create a Player struct, it must contain a string name, and an integer punctuation
  a- Create a Player-type struct vector, with up to 1000 players.
  
  b- They must be filled with random values (names do not need make sense)
  
  c - There must not be a vector of names and a vector of separate points.
  
2- There should be three functions, displayPlayers() and bestScores10() and bestScores100() :
  a- displayPlayers should show the name of all players on the console sorted in alphabetical order.
  
  b- bestscores10() should show the top 10 scores on the console,ordered from best to worst.
  
  c- bestScores100() should show the top 100 on the console scores, sorted from best to worst, and players with scores Equals must appear in alphabetical order.
  
3- To do the sorting, you must implement 3 sorting algorithms many different:
  a- Each function must use a different sorting algorithm.
  
  b- One of the algorithms must be chosen between: Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort.
  
  c- Another algorithm must be chosen between: Quick Sort or Merge Sort.
  
  d- The last algorithm should be Shell Sort (Not seen in class).
